Testing
=======

In StackStorm we have a multiple types of tests described bellow.

To run a particular test suite we use Makefile targets. Underneath, those make
targets create a virtual environment, install the required Python dependencies
and use nose Python test runner to run the tests.

Unit tests
----------

Unit tests exercise small units / pieces of code (usually those are functions)
and don't require any services or 3rd party dependencies to run. Besides
manipulating the state in memory, they usually have no other side affects.

In cases where a unit you are testing requires a service to run, you should use
``mock`` library to mock the service and the result.

Note: Currently some of the unit tests require database (MongoDB) and message
bus (RabbitMQ) to run. We are in process of moving those tests to the
integration test suite.

Unit tests are located in ``<component>/tests/unit/``, e.g.
``st2api/tests/unit/``.

Integration tests
-----------------

Integration tests exercise small pieces of code which require some StackStorm
services such as a database and message bus to run. Usually the have side
affects (e.g. changing the state in the db, etc.).

Integration tests are located in ``<component>/tests/integration``, e.g.
``st2actions/tests/integration/``.

End to end tests
----------------

End to end test exercise the system as a whole (end to end) and require all the
StackStorm services and dependencies (database, message bus, etc.) to run.

Usually they exercise the API and the system using the CLI and / or the Python
API client.

Running all the tests
---------------------

To run all the tests, run the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    make pytests

Running all the unit tests
--------------------------

To run all the unit tests, run the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    make unit-tests

Running all the integration tests
---------------------------------

To run all the integration tests, run the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    make itests

Running all the tests in a test file
------------------------------------

To run all the tests located in a single test file, move to the root of the
repository and run the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    nosetests --nocapture <path to the test file>

For example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    nosetests --nocapture st2reactor/tests/unit/test_enforce.py

``--nocapture`` flag tells the nose test runner to directly output any stdout
and stderr generated during the test execution instead of capturing and
ignoring it.
